/* 
 * This module provides functionality to sound the beeper at
 * a certain frequency on the Dragon21 board from Wytec. It uses 
 * the ECT channel 5 for timing the toggle of the speaker.
 *
 *
 * The bus frequency is currently defined here, but should actually
 * taken from where the clock and reset module is initialized.
 * Since this is done in the debug monitor, we write it out here
 * again.
 *
 * Make sure the interrupt vector routine is properly hooked into
 * the interrupt vector table in file Monitor_linker.prm like this:
 *
 * VECTOR ADDRESS 0xFFE4  isr_tc5 
 *
 * IDE used: Metrowerks Codewarrior
